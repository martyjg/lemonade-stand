### GA WDI London - Project 1

You are tasked with opened and managaing a lemonade stand.

Each day begins with the purchasing of lemonade ingredients: lemons, ice and and sugar. These ingredients each produce a certain amount of lemonade and can only be bought in set quantities.

Each day also has a weather report. In warmer weather sales increase but in wet or stormy weather sales are much lower.

The player must also choose a location where they will set up their stand and the price they will set their lemonade at for the day. Certain locations are more expensive for rent but can also increase sales.

Upon setting these variables, the player is ready to start their day of sales.

The sales of lemonade is effected by the price, location and weather. The actual weather has a slight random chance to vary on what the reported weather condition was.

After a a day of sales, the player is presented with their financial breakdown (stock costs, location rent, sales and balance). Some ingredients can be carried on until the next day. Ice melts after one day, lemons last up to two days and sugar does not expire.

The game can currently continue as long as the player can keep their balance above zero.


### The build ![alt text][logo2]

HTML5, CSS and javascript along with a jQuery library were used to build this game.
The graphics and animation were created in GIMP.
The featured font is ARCADECLASSIC.TFF.

### Problems and Challenges ![alt text][logo3]

I learnt a great deal from building this game and had a chance to practice my styling. Maintaining and presenting surplus stock from the previous day was a challenge for myself and it's something I would to develop further as part of the game design.


### Further developments ![alt text][logo4]

Lemonade Stand has a lot of potential for future builds, I would like to implement options and challenges for the player including an interaction effect between the variables that decide the daily sales (e.g. an indoor location is less effected by wet weather conditions or that in certain locations, customers are willing to pay more for the lemonade).
