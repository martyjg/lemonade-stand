# Lemonade Stand
### GA WDI London - Project 1

You are tasked with opened and managaing a lemonade stand.

Each day begins with the purchasing of lemonade ingredients: lemons, ice and and sugar. These ingredients each produce a certain amount of lemonade and can only be bought in set quantities.

Each day also has a weather report. In warmer weather sales increase but in wet or stormy weather sales are much lower.

The player must also choose a location where they will set up their stand for the day. Certain locations are more expensive for rent but can also increase sales.

Upon setting these variables, the player is ready to start their day of sales.
